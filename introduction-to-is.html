	<p>“Computer literacy is a contact with the activity of computing deep enough to make the computational equivalent of reading and writing fluent and enjoyable.”<cite> – Alan Kay</cite>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was a college student it was perfectly acceptable to casually utter the phrase: “I don’t do computers.” The sentence was meant to confidently convey that the individual was not an awkward “geek” who played dungeons and dragons, but rather a “cool cat” with real friends and, possibly, even a modicum of popularity among peers.</p>

<p>Today, most youngsters know that saying “I don’t do computers” sounds as strident as “I don’t do reading” would have been in my day. <a href="link: https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">Software is eating the world</a>, <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2009/02/25/googles-chief-economist-hal-varian-on-statistics-and-data/">statistician is the sexy job of the future</a>, and we soon may be <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/4/10/the-first-decade-of-augmented-reality">immersed in mixed reality worlds</a>. Information technology is definitely “cool” as shown by a recent Audi commercial proclaiming that… “Intelligence is the new Rock and Roll.”</p>

<p>College students today are digital natives, they have an almost symbiotic relationship with digital technology. They all carry laptops, and their smartphones are an extension of their body… and sometimes their being.  However, despite having embraced the digital lifestyle, I worry that most college level youth are not computer literate. For over a decade I have been hearing from colleagues who don’t teach freshmen level Information Systems courses a variation of the following quote: “Young students are computer literate. They are born with computers and they learn Word and Excel in high school.” The misguided implication is that they don’t need an introductory computing course. Let me tell you, this was not true in 2004 and it is not true in 2017! It is, in fact, a testament of the unbridled success of IT over the last 30 years that most young people are computer illiterate – despite having been surrounded by digital technology since birth. As IT becomes more powerful and complex it becomes easier to use. Thanks to the malleability of software, digital technologies are one of the few things that become easier to operate as they increase in complexity and scope.</p>

<p>This is a critical misunderstanding. Using the smartphone to Snap and the computer to watch YouTube videos does not imply computer literacy. Using Moodle to get assignments and writing term papers in Microsoft Word doesn’t either. As the opening quote suggests, computer literacy is about reaching a level of fluency and skill that makes the activity of using computers effortless, and even enjoyable. Ponder that last point for a second. When computing is effortless and enjoyable, you are much more likely to want to push beyond your current level of skills and challenge yourself. Perhaps you try computer programming or you try to figure out what all the hype about Artificial Intelligence is really about. Conversely, if one is inefficient and unsure in their computer use, they are likely to loathe the experience when they have to do “computer work,” and certainly will shun any further learning. This is a very important point because computing is a foundational skill.</p>

<p>The report <a href="http://content.thirdway.org/publications/714/Dancing-With-Robots.pdf">“Dancing with Robots,”</a> introduce the notion of foundational skills - those “skills that beget skills.” In 2017 computing is the ultimate foundational skill. As software is embraced by virtually all industries and it mediates more and more aspect of everyday life, I would argue that computer literacy is the most critical foundation skill a young person can develop.</p>

<p>Narrowly defined, basic digital fluency appears to be a critical discriminant between good paying jobs, while <a href="http://on.wsj.com/1wYxvB6">occupations that don’t require computer literacy are on their way to extinction</a>. A recent analysis of “middle-skill” careers shows that three fourths of them require spreadsheet and word processing proficiency. Moreover, <a href="http://burning-glass.com/research/digital-skills-gap/">digitally intensive middle-skill jobs are growing faster and pay better than their “non-digital” counterpart </a>. If the only constant in life is change, as Heraclitus recognized more than two thousand years ago, it seems that rather than trying to bring back old jobs, we should prepare for the future. Computer literacy is the foundational skill for such future.</p>

<p>The argument I am making here however is broader than the simplistic advice your uncle Barry gave you at the last family reunion: “learn computers young lad, and you’ll get yourself a good job.”</p>

<p>A 1996 Steve Jobs interview with Fresh Air’s Terry Gross expresses clearly the transition of computer from being a niche product to being a central artifact of modern society.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I think our major contribution was in bringing a liberal arts point of view to the use of computers… Our goal was to bring a liberal arts perspective and a liberal arts audience to what had traditionally been a very geeky technology and a very geeky audience.” <cite>— Steve Jobs</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When computing is effortless and enjoyable, you are likely to incorporate it in your other passions and in your day-to-day activities. All forms of creativity, activities, and professions have been profoundly influenced by digital technology, from <a href="https://www.wired.com/2000/08/the-garage-band-success-story/">music</a>, to <a href="https://crezeo.com/blog/nike-case-study/">sports</a>, to <a href="http://connectivity.cqrollcall.com/9-twitter-strategies-for-advocacy-campaigns/">politics</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/24/the-benefits-of-digital-drawing/">visual arts</a>.</p>

<p>As Steve Jobs recognized more than 20 years ago, the computer has become a prerequisite to being a productive member of modern society.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>“In my perspective … science and computer science is a liberal art, it’s something everyone should know how to use, at least, and harness in their life. It’s not something that should be relegated to 5 percent of the population over in the corner. It’s something that everybody should be exposed to and everyone should have mastery of to some extent, and that’s how we viewed computation and these computation devices.” <cite>- Steve Jobs</cite>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>“The computer is a bicycle for the mind”</em> is another metaphor used by Jobs in order to convey the importance of technology in everyday life activities.</p>

<p>Given the importance of becoming computer literate in our society, it becomes of great importance being able to design a course that can accomplish the goal. But, what does a course that enables computer literacy look like? How do you organize such a course?</p>

<p>I think that you do it by addressing three critical domains:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Practical and relevant applied skills</strong>. Microsoft Word and Excel, given their dominant position as the productivity tools of choice in modern organizations are the best start.  Most people who put Excel as a skill on their resume should not! Becoming legitimately good at using Microsoft Excel is empowering for any one, particularly for young students at the beginning of a career. More subtly, becoming proficient with advanced Word and Excel functionalities forces people to confront their limited conceptual understanding of how Information Technology works. </li>
<li><strong>Information Technology foundations</strong>. While people want practical skills, they must realize that using digital technology without a foundational understanding of how they work, is like learning to drive without having any idea of how a steering wheel, engine and transmission work. You may pass the driving test, but you will never be a confident driver, and the first time your car has trouble you will feel completely helpless. One of course need not be an electrical engineer to operate a smartphone. However, many people underestimate the upside potential that just a few basic IT concepts, accessible to any college student who is willing to put in a bit of effort, can provide to eager young minds. </li>
<li><strong>Information Systems foundations</strong>. The greatest majority of individuals enrolled in a computer literacy course are not going to be computing professionals. They will not be developing hardware or software in their career, but they will be using digital technology to perform jobs in areas (hopefully) that they find interesting and enjoyable – business, biology, psychology, nursing. Keeping with Job’s metaphor, they will not be building the bicycle for the mind, but riding it. As they will be doing that as part of an organization (business or non-profit), they need to understand how digital technology enables and constraints how groups and society achieve their goals.</li>

These three domains are clearly synergistic and intertwined. What you really want to be able to do is to apply technology to your domain (information systems foundations), but to do so you need to have a modicum of understanding of how things work (information technology foundations) that will ensure that you are efficient and effective in using digital technology in your job (practical and relevant applied skills).
